/*
Given an array of size N, find the smallest positive integer value that is either not presented in the array or cannot be represented as a sum(coz sum means you are adding two or more elements) of some elements from the array.
Example 1:

Input: 
N = 6
array[] = {1, 10, 3, 11, 6, 15}
Output: 
2
Explanation:
2 is the smallest integer value that cannot 
be represented as sum of elements from the array.
Example 2:

Input: 
N = 3
array[] = {1, 1, 1}
Output: 
4
Explanation: 
1 is present in the array. 
2 can be created by combining two 1s.
3 can be created by combining three 1s.
4 is the smallest integer value that cannot be 
represented as sum of elements from the array.

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function smallestpositive() which takes the array and N as input parameters and returns the smallest positive integer value that cannot be represented as the sum of some elements from the array.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N * Log(N))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 106
1 ≤ array[i] ≤ 109
The array may contain duplicates.
